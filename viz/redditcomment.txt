Posted this yesterday, but there was a few big mistakes that I fixed(hopefully).

This graph represent all professional League of Legends players (active and retired). 

Players are connected together if they were on the same team at one time.

The edges are weighted by how how long they played together, so players who played together for
a long time cluster together. 

The size of each node represents how long their career was and the color
represents which competitive region they played the most in.

The data was scraped from [lol.esportswikis](http://lol.esportswikis.com/), scrubbed, and formated using python

The visualization was created in Gephi.

If you notice any mistakes, let me know. The data source is far from perfect and contained some incomplete or inaccurate info and despite my best efforts, scrubbing data is tricky.
